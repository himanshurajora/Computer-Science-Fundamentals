/**
 * What is a graph?
 * When we talk about graphs, the first thing that likely comes to mind is the conventional graphs used to model data. 
 * In computer science, the term has a completely different meaning.
 * In programming, a graph is a common data structure that consists of 
 * a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and edges. The edges connect the vertices to form a network. 
 * An edge can be uni-directional or bi-directional. Edges are also known as arrows in a directed graph and may contain
 *  values that show the required cost to traverse from one vertex to another. A vertex is similar to linked list nodes. 
 * A pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge. This communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex.
